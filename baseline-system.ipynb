    "### Definition of ERICs\n",
    "ERICs are characterized by argumentative, respectful exchanges containing persuasive, informative, and/or sympathetic comments. They tend to stay on topic with the original article and not to contain funny, mean, or sarcastic comments. We found differences between the distribution of annotations made by trained and untrained anno- tators, but high levels of agreement within each group, suggesting that crowdsourcing annotations for this task is reliable."
