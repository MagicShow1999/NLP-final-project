    "Next, we try to classify the ERIC by observing the certain attributes of each text. We are not selecting all columns because for instance, the sd_type columns contain more than one attribute of the certain text because this column represents the properties of the whole thread of dicussions and so every text belonged to that thread is labeled the same tag even if that comment does not correspond with the attribute it is labeled. Also the column 'topic' mostly contains 'off-topic' comments which seems to be strange so we are not taking this column into consideration. Thus, we ultimately decide to choose 'constructiveclass', 'persuasiveness', 'tone' as our standard to classify ERICs. An ERIC should have a constructive label, persuasive label and an Informative tone."
